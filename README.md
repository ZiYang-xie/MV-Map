# `MV-Map`: Next Generation HD-Map Solution
Welcome to the `MV-Map` GitHub repository!   
This repository contains the official implementation of the MV-Map pipeline, a novel offboard High-Definition Map (HD-Map) generation method based on the paper '[MV-Map: Offboard HD-Map Generation with Multi-view Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08851)'. Explore the power of multi-view consistency and transform your mapping capabilities with our region-centric approach.

## Update Log
- 2023/09/27: Pre-release the codebase of MV-Map.


## TODO
- [ ] Update Dataloader.
- [ ] Training script of MV-Map.
- [ ] Evaluation code of MV-Map.
- [ ] Release the pre-trained model of MV-Map.
