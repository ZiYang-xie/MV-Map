# MV-Map: Next Generation HD-Map Solution
Welcome to the MV-Map GitHub repository!   
This repository contains the official implementation of the MV-Map pipeline, a novel offboard High-Definition Map (HD-Map) generation method based on the paper '[MV-Map: Offboard HD-Map Generation with Multi-view Consistency]()'.   
Explore the power of multi-view consistency and transform your mapping capabilities with our region-centric approach.
